Hey there!
Today i assembled this quick ready to use code which can help ease the problem of sorting objects from images
this project is very exciting,
you just fetch the program with an image containing lot of objects with different shapes and it will
automatially find them, crop them and save them separately for you.

#======= Required Modules =========
pip install cv3
#==================================

>> Just run the "find_and_crop_objects.py" and see the magic
>> It will pickup "the sample_image.jpg" will find the objects such as book,cup, badges
and save them separately after croping in a separate directory
